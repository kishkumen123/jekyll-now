title: CS 373 - Week of 29 12 Sep - 18 Sep

## What did I do this past week?
During this past week me and my partner worked in finishing the netflix assignment. I felt that this assignment was some what easier than the last. It took much less time to get started and figure out a solution but that might have been since we had already figured out how to turn everything from collatz.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
The things that got in our way is us not understanding how the proffesor wanted us to pass in the caches. So in the end we ended up hard coding that information

## What will I do next week?
For next week I will have to brush up on all the information discussed these past two weeks and make sure I fully understand all the concepts so that when the exam comes, I dont have to study everything from the start. I will also start talking to my current parenter about who we would like to team up with for the next assignment.

## Tip-of-the-week
Talk to every company that ever comes your way at UT, it is worth it. Even if you think they wont remember you or the interaction doesnt matter. The more you talk to people the easier it becomes to connect with people and land those interviews that you want.
