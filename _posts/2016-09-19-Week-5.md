title: CS 373 - Week of 29 12 Sep - 18 Sep
---
## What did I do this past week?
During this past week, I worked on the Netflix project by getting all the basic setup complete. That way for next week all I have to do is code out the solution with very little getting in my way. I also brushed up on some of the information that was discussed in class.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
Not many things were in my way during this week. It all I worked on was the setup for the project, it was mostly just getting all the information I needed so I could complete the project effectively.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I will work on finishing the project. I dont expect that I will make my own caches so I will be using other peoples caches that they have created. I also have never SSH'ed into our labs machines so I have to figure out how to do that since I prefer working on my own laptop rather than in the labs in our department.

## Tip-of-the-week
Installing linux on your primary machine is great. But be aware that there are many standard applications out there that are not supported in linux and you will have to find alternatives or work arounds that fit what you are looking for.
