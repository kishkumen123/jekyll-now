title: CS 373 - Week of 17 Oct - 23 Oct
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent the majority of the time working on the IDB projcet. For my team I worked on flask backend and setting up the tables and views. In the beggining it took a while for me to really wrap my head around what I was supposed to do and how I was supposed to use flask effective. But eventually I believe I got the hang of it and managed to use it effectively.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
Nothing got in my way this week. I utilized my time to write as many of the built in functions in python as I could so I could be prepared.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I will discuss with my teammates the new project that is up to look at. We will discuss strategies and what we want to focus on to make sure we do everything correctly. I will also go over a lot of the new information that was discussed in class, especially decorators because I dont fully understand them.

## Tip-of-the-week
Always keep your resume up to date and fresh, keep your portfolio updates aswell. If you are not constantly updating both of those then you should. It helps you move older and maybe out of date projects out of your resume and newer things that you might be more proud of.
