title: CS 373 - Week of 26 Sep - 2 Oct
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I realized that I was not fully understanding some of the material that was discussed in class. I noticed this after I I did not get any questions correct on the last two quizzes. So I decided to open up a python terminal and hack away until I understood what works when and how each approuch could be beneficial.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
Nothing got in my way this week. Other than not really understanding the material. The python terminal was very helpful.

## What will I do next week?
Next week we have an exam, so I will spend the majority of my time studying for it. I will go over the list of topics that Downing posted for us to go over and make sure I understand them fully. This will not only help me for the exam but it will also help me for future projects in this class any potentially future interviews that I have with companies./

## Tip-of-the-week
Every week set aside six or so hours of your time, and work on a project. It could be a continueing project or a new one but do something. Put it on git hub or on your portfolio. This will tell companies that you are active in the coding world and you are up to date in the computer science world.
