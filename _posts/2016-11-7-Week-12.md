title: CS 373 - Week of 7 Nov - 13 Nov
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week me and my team spent our time working on our up comming project that is due next week. We managed to get a lot of the miscellaneous stuff out of the way so that we can focus on the major tasks for the project. I also spent some time looking back at the notes so that I can understand the material. Even thought I understand it, im finding it hard to apply it in practice.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
Nothing got in my way this week. I utilized my time to write as many of the built in functions in python as I could so I could be prepared.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I will finish the project with my team and work on completing it efficiently. We will also work on our presentation that we will deliver to te class. I will also spent some time preparing for the coming exam that is scheduled. I feel that this exam is going to be harder than the last and is going to talk about a wider range of material so I feel that I should be prepared.

## Tip-of-the-week
tmux is a great tool for managing your work nevironment with in a single terminal. It has a lot of functionality from window management to multiple sessions. This is especially usefull if your a vim user. Take a look and try it out https://tmux.github.io/
