title: CS 373 - Week of 14 Nov - 20 Nov
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent my time with the team finishing up the project. We finished our search engine and updated our about pages. I also spent a lot of my time reviewing python code and older material that was on the first exam. This way I wont have to worry about that material as much when im studying for newer material that will be in this comming exam.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
It took us some time to get the visualization to work because it was me and another backend programmer that were trying to get it set up. We were having a lot of JS issues and needed frontend help with it.

## What will I do next week?
This week I will have an awesome thanks giving. I will also spend the majority of my time looking at everything that I need to study for regarding the coming exam. I dont feel comfertable with it yet and I need to spend a good amount of time practicing.

## Tip-of-the-week
Consider becoming a teachers assistant to a computer science class. If you feel that there is a class or a topic that you studying that your not too familiar with anymore, TAing for that class will help you relearn all the necessary skills and knowledge that you may have lost. It pays well too.
