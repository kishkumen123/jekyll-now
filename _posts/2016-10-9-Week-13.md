title: CS 373 - Week of 14 Nov - 20 Nov
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent my time with the team finishing up the project. We finished our search engine and updated our about pages. I also spent a lot of my time reviewing python code and older material that was on the first exam. This way I wont have to worry about that material as much when im studying for newer material that will be in this comming exam.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
It took us some time to get the visualization to work because it was me and another backend programmer that were trying to get it set up. We were having a lot of JS issues and needed frontend help with it.

## What will I do next week?
This week I will have an awesome thanks giving. I will also spend the majority of my time looking at everything that I need to study for regarding the coming exam. I dont feel comfertable with it yet and I need to spend a good amount of time practicing.

## Tip-of-the-week
Spend some time familiarizing yourself with as many different software engineering topics as possible. Knowing a little about a lot goes a long way, especialy during interviews and just general discussion. It also help when starting new projects or jumping into existing projects knowing a little about what you are supposed to be working on and the tools that you are using.
