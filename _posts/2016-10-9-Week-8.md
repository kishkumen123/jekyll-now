title: CS 373 - Week of 10 Oct - 16 Oct
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent the majority of my time working with my team and figuring out the direction we wanted to take regarding our project. After we submited our idea and it was accepted we had a goal that we all agreed on and began working on. On top of that I spent a lot of time learning how to use flask and figuring out common code structure so that I could use it for the projcet.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
Nothing really got in my way this past week. Other than learning something new and feeling like I knew very little about it.

## What will I do next week?
For next week I will refine all the flask code I wrote and make sure each and every team member knows what they are doing so that we can complete this assignment effectively. On top of that I will spend some more time learning more about flask as well as react so that I can be familiar with front end development.

## Tip-of-the-week
If you are ever stuck on a problem and cant figure it out, step away from the computer and do something else. Getting frustrated only makes it worse and results in poor solutions. Instead walk away and change settings, allowing you to clear your mind and thing of the problem in a different way.
