title: CS 373 - Week of 3 Oct - 9 Oct
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent the majority of my time studying for the exam on Thursday. I had a vague idea of what might be on the exam such as creating classes, generators and methods that utilize yeild but I was not sure if the specific caveats for types and how to use them would be specified. Because of this I filled my cheat sheat with all those rules and I ended up not using my cheat sheat at all.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
Nothing got in my way this week. I utilized my time to write as many of the built in functions in python as I could so I could be prepared.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I will begin discussing with my new team topics and approuches that we want to take for the new assignment. It seems like there is a lot of work to do and staying on top of it and correctly deligating work will go a long way in this assingment.

## Tip-of-the-week
Spend some time familiarizing yourself with as many different software engineering topics as possible. Knowing a little about a lot goes a long way, especialy during interviews and just general discussion. It also help when starting new projects or jumping into existing projects knowing a little about what you are supposed to be working on and the tools that you are using.
