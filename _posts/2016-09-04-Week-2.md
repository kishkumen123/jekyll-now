title: CS 373 - Week of 24 Aug - 28 Aug
---
## What did I do this past week?
During the second week I found myself catching up on all the information I found myself feeling behind on. I decided to format my laptop and install linux on. This helped with several of the issues I was having with getting my environment set up for the class in order to complete the assignments.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
I mostly felt that Windows 10 was the bigest issue regarding things being in my way. Every step was a struggle and I had to figure out a windows equivalent to very basic linux commands. I finally decided to install a fresh Linux OS on my laptop to make my life easier.

## What will I do next week?
Next I will work on completing the assignment by making sure docker works correctly and the collatz files run correctly. Then I will follow the steps that professor Downing gave us in class in order to perform well in this assignment. This first assignment will give me some very good grounds in order to pick up the rest of the material in a steady pace

## Tip-of-the-week
Gary Bernhardt is someone who helped shape my style and approuch to programming. He has many videos regarding test driven development, unit testing and many other topics. One that is free and very interesting is regarding writing simpler code and simple values as oposed to more complex objects. [boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
