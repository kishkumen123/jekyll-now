title: CS 373 - Week of 31 Oct - 6 Nov
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week me and my team worked on finishing our project. We managed to split up the work in such a way that we had everything done by Wednesday. Thursday we spent the day making sure everything works accordingly and everything that was asked of us to be turned in was turned in correctly. For this assignment I focused on miscellaneous tasks such as preventing the URL to redirect and setting up the database server on our aws instance.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
AWS was a little hard to work with when it came to routing the URL and preventing it from rerouting to AWS's ip. I had to use other tutorials outside of aws to make it work.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I will work with my team on to determine all the tasks that need to be completed and divide them up between each memeber so that we can complete them. I will also review some of the material discussed in class because I felt like I was not getting it 100%.

## Tip-of-the-week
There is value in learning how to do something from scratch yourself, because you get to learn all the wrong ways of how to do something before you learn the right way to do it. But there is also value in learning how to do it right once from someone who already knows how to do it.
