title: CS 373 - Week of 24 Aug - 28 Aug
---

During this first week of class I was out of town, so I spent the majority of my time reading up on some of the material that I thought was necessary for the class. I didnt have my personal computer and could not access the machines in our labs, so all I could do was prepare myself for the comming weeks and hope that I would not be too far behined.

Regarding issues or obstacles that got in my way, other than feeling slightly behind due to being out of town the first week, I did not find many obstacles. Although it felt like there was a lot of information I had to familiarize myself with, I am slowely getting aquanted with all the information.

Next week I will work on completing the assignment. After reading up on all the information required and installing all the prerequisite applicaitons, I think I am ready to breeze through this first assignment and complete it efficiently.

Overall I found the class to be very engaging. I think most people would find the segment in which professor Downing calls upon students to join him in a 1 on 1 problem sovling session to be uncomfortable, but I think it is even more helpful than lecturing to the entire class, even if he is not speaking to me directly.
