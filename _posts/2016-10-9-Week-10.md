title: CS 373 - Week of 24 Oct - 30 Oct
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week me and my team spent time looking into stratigies as to how we wanted to approuch our project. We decided that we were going to use flask to load the correct html files that we wanted, as well as use it to pull information and store it into our data base. We also set up our database and made a good base for us to make sure we get the projcet done next week.

## Whatâ€™s in my way?
Nothing got in my way this week. I utilized my time to look into how flask handles parsing information from api's so that we can get that information effectively 

## What will I do next week?
Next week I will work with my team to complete the project effectively. I will also look into react because I feel that I know very little about it since I was not responsible for that part of the assignment.

## Tip-of-the-week
When learning a new library, try and read the entire documentation first before using it. It may give you a better base understanding of how to use all the tools and use it effectively.
